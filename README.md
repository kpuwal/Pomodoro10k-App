Pomodoro10k is a mobile app that combines two theories:

### **Pomodoro Technique**
is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The original technique has six steps:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).

A goal of the technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow.

### **10,000 Hours Rule**
is the theory that it takes 10 000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.
